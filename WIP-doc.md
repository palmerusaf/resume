## Personal Projects

### MemeSpace (github.com/palmerusaf/memespace)

#### Initial bullets

- storyboard
- firebase and react query

#### WIP bullets

#### Finalized bullets

- "Developed a standardized troubleshooting template to address a programming issue with no identifiable errors, reducing the next troubleshooting session time from two days to two hours."
- "Utilized git bisect to isolate a production build failure to one commit affecting three files, providing crucial context to troubleshoot and fix the issue."
- "Successfully integrated a 3rd party API to fulfill core functionality requirements, creating a module to fetch content, selector components, and modals for UI access, resulting in the site's access to an impressive library of 999 memes."
- created coding conventions
  - "Created a comprehensive conventions document outlining 10 key decisions, including file naming, folder structure, and Git commits, which effectively reduced low-value decision-making and eliminated decision fatigue. This standardized approach allowed for faster and more meaningful development."
  - "Created a conventions document covering 10 key decisions, such as file naming and Git commits, which reduced decision fatigue and enabled faster, more meaningful development."
- firebase and react query
  - "Successfully integrated a BaaS solution (Firebase) to provide backend storage and user authentication, and implemented caching to reduce network requests by creating a module that combined Firebase with React Query. Also, created custom hooks to integrate Firebase auth state and added a loading UI, resulting in the fulfillment of core social functionality with optimized network performance."

#### WIP bullets

Situation:
Task:
Action:
Result:

{- create ai
Situation: game needed an enemy opponent to play against
Task: Create a basic AI
Action: modified player class to add automated functionality
Result: fulfilled core requirement
}

#### Finalized bullets

- "Used TDD to write 35 tests covering 3 modules and 16 functions, resulting in SOLID code that was easier to refactor and understand"
- "Applied Martin Fowler's Refactoring principles, including the Two Hats and Incremental Refactoring principles, to systematically refactor a disorganized codebase. As a result, a new feature, the random ship placement button, was implemented in just 15 minutes.
- "Implemented a style system using SCSS and the BEM method, with separate files for each component, resulting in a coherent, easy-to-use, high-quality style system"
